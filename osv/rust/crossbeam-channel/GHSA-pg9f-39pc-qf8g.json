  "summary": "crossbeam-channel Vulnerable to Double Free on Drop",
  "details": "The internal `Channel` type's `Drop` method has a race\nwhich could, in some circumstances, lead to a double-free.\nThis could result in memory corruption.\n\nQuoting from the\n[upstream description in merge request \\#1187](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187#issue-2980761131):\n\n\u003e The problem lies in the fact that `dicard_all_messages` contained two paths that could lead to `head.block` being read but only one of them would swap the value. This meant that `dicard_all_messages` could end up observing a non-null block pointer (and therefore attempting to free it) without setting `head.block` to null. This would then lead to `Channel::drop` making a second attempt at dropping the same pointer.\n\nThe bug was introduced while fixing a memory leak, in\nupstream [MR \\#1084](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1084),\nfirst published in 0.5.12.\n\nThe fix is in\nupstream [MR \\#1187](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187)\nand has been published in 0.5.15",
