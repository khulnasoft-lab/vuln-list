  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vyper",
  "Title": "vyper performs double eval of the argument of sqrt",
  "Description": "Using the `sqrt` builtin can result in multiple eval evaluation of side effects when the argument has side-effects. The bug is more difficult (but not impossible!) to trigger as of 0.3.4, when the unique symbol fence was introduced (https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2914).\n\nA contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.",
