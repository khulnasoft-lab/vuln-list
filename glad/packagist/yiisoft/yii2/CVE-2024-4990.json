  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-4990",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/yiisoft/yii2",
  "Title": "Unsafe Reflection in base Component class in yiisoft/yii2",
  "Description": "Yii2 supports attaching Behaviors to Components by setting properties having the format `'as \u003cbehaviour-name\u003e'`.\n\nInternally this is done using the `__set()` magic method. If the value passed to this method is not an instance of the `Behavior` class, a new object is instantiated using `Yii::createObject($value)`. However, there is no validation check that verifies that `$value` is a valid `Behavior` class name or configuration. An attacker that can control the content of the $value variable can then instantiate arbitrary classes, passing parameters to their constructors and then invoking setter methods.",
