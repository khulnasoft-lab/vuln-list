  "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in orcparse.c of ORC versions prior to 0.4.39. If a developer is tricked to process a specially crafted file with the affected ORC compiler, an arbitrary code may be executed on the developer's build environment. This may lead to compromise of developer machines or CI build environments.",

  "Notes": [
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e from the security advisory: This only affects developers and CI environments using orcc, not users of liborc."
