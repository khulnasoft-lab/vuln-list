  "summary": "containerd has an integer overflow in User ID handling",
  "details": "### Impact\nA bug was found in containerd where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user.\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in the following containerd versions: \n\n* 2.0.4 (Fixed in https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1a43cb6a1035441f9aca8f5666a9b3ef9e70ab20)\n* 1.7.27 (Fixed in https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da)\n* 1.6.38 (Fixed in https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cf158e884cfe4812a6c371b59e4ea9bc4c46e51a)\n\nUsers should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.\n\n### Credits\nThe containerd project would like to thank [Benjamin Koltermann](https://github.com/p4ck3t0) and [emxll](https://github.com/emxll) for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n### References\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-40635\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\n\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)",
