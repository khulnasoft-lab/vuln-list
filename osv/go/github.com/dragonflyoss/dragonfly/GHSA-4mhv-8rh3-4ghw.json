  ],
  "summary": "DragonFly vulnerable to panics due to nil pointer dereference when using variables created alongside an error",
  "details": "### Impact\nWe found two instances in the DragonFly codebase where the first return value of a function is dereferenced even when the function returns an error (figures 9.1 and 9.2). This can result in a nil dereference, and cause code to panic. The codebase may contain additional instances of the bug.\n\n```golang\nrequest, err := source.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, parentReq.Url,\nparentReq.UrlMeta.Header)\nif err != nil {\n       log.Errorf(\"generate url [%v] request error: %v\", request.URL, err)\n       span.RecordError(err)\n       return err\n}\n```\n\nEve is a malicious actor operating a peer machine. She sends a dfdaemonv1.DownRequest request to her peer Alice. Alice’s machine receives the request, resolves a nil variable in the server.Download method, and panics.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Trail of Bits, you can see the [full report](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com).",
