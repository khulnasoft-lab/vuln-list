(This Composer package is also known as phpecc/phpecc on GitHub, previously known as the Matyas Danter ECC library.)\n\nParagon Initiative Enterprises [hard-forked phpecc/phpecc](https://github.com/phpecc/phpecc/issues/289) and discovered the issue in the original code, then released v2.0.1 which fixes the vulnerability.
