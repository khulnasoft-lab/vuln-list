Similarly it will warn if the output binary contains a\n    segment with all three of the read, write and execute permission\n    bits set.  These warnings are intended to help developers identify\n    programs which might be vulnerable to attack via these executable\n    memory regions.\n    The warnings are enabled by default but can be disabled via a command\n    line option.  It is also possible to build a linker with the warnings\n    disabled, should that be necessary.\n  * The ELF linker now supports a --package-metadata option that allows\n    embedding a JSON payload in accordance to the Package Metadata\n    specification.\n  * In linker scripts it is now possible to use TYPE=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; in an output\n    section description to set the section type value.\n  * The objdump program now supports coloured/colored syntax\n    highlighting of its disassembler output for some architectures.\n    (Currently: AVR, RiscV, s390, x86, x86_64).\n  * The nm program now supports a --no-weak/-W option to make it ignore\n    weak symbols.\n  * The readelf and objdump programs now support a -wE option to prevent\n    them from attempting to access debuginfod servers when following\n    links.\n  * The objcopy program's --weaken, --weaken-symbol, and\n  - -weaken-symbols options now works with unique symbols as well.\n- Rebase binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff, binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff,\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff and remove binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz.\n- For now use --disable-gprofng.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1142579 aka CVE-2019-1010204 aka PR23765\n\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n\nPackage blog was updated:\n\n- Add patch blog.dif  * Fix big endian cast problems to be able to read commands\n    and ansers (blogctl) as well as passphrases (blogd)\n\nPackage ca-certificates-mozilla was updated:\n\n- Updated to 2.62 state of Mozilla SSL root CAs (bsc#1214248)  Added:\n  - Atos TrustedRoot Root CA ECC G2 2020\n  - Atos TrustedRoot Root CA ECC TLS 2021\n  - Atos TrustedRoot Root CA RSA G2 2020\n  - Atos TrustedRoot Root CA RSA TLS 2021\n  - BJCA Global Root CA1\n  - BJCA Global Root CA2\n  - LAWtrust Root CA2 (4096)\n  - Sectigo Public Email Protection Root E46\n  - Sectigo Public Email Protection Root R46\n  - Sectigo Public Server Authentication Root E46\n  - Sectigo Public Server Authentication Root R46\n  - SSL.com Client ECC Root CA 2022\n  - SSL.com Client RSA Root CA 2022\n  - SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022\n  - SSL.com TLS RSA Root CA 2022\n  Removed CAs:\n  - Chambers of Commerce Root\n  - E-Tugra Certification Authority\n  - E-Tugra Global Root CA ECC v3\n  - E-Tugra Global Root CA RSA v3\n  - Hongkong Post Root CA 1\n\n- Updated to 2.60 state of Mozilla SSL root CAs (bsc#1206622)\n  Removed CAs:\n  - Global Chambersign Root\n  - EC-ACC\n  - Network Solutions Certificate Authority\n  - Staat der Nederlanden EV Root CA\n  - SwissSign Platinum CA - G2\n  Added CAs:\n  - DIGITALSIGN GLOBAL ROOT ECDSA CA\n  - DIGITALSIGN GLOBAL ROOT RSA CA\n  - Security Communication ECC RootCA1\n  - Security Communication RootCA3\n  Changed trust:\n  - TrustCor certificates only trusted up to Nov 30 (bsc#1206212)\n- Removed CAs (bsc#1206212) as most code does not handle \u0026quot;valid before nov 30 2022\u0026quot;\n  and it is not clear how many certs were issued for SSL middleware by TrustCor:\n  - TrustCor RootCert CA-1\n  - TrustCor RootCert CA-2\n  - TrustCor ECA-1\n  Patch: remove-trustcor.patch\n\nPackage ca-certificates was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2+git20240416.98ae794 (bsc#1221184):  * Use flock to serialize calls (boo#1188500)\n  * Make certbundle.run container friendly\n  * Create /var/lib/ca-certificates if needed\n\nPackage catatonit was updated:\n\n- Update to catatonit v0.2.0.  * Change license to GPL-2.0-or-later.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - 99bb9048f.patch\n\n- Update to catatont v0.1.7\n- This release adds the ability for catatonit to be used as the only\n  process in a pause container, by passing the -P flag (in this mode no\n  subprocess is spawned and thus no signal forwarding is done).\n\n- Add 99bb9048f.patch: configure.ac: call AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE only\n  once.

modules no longer taint the kernel, update the respective documentation\n  in README.SUSE:\n  * Describe that support status can be obtained at runtime for each\n  module from /sys/module/$MODULE/supported and for the entire system\n  from /sys/kernel/supported. This provides a way how to now check that\n  the kernel has any externally supported modules loaded.\n  * Remove a mention that externally supported modules taint the kernel,\n  but keep the information about bit 16 (X) and add a note that it is\n  still tracked per module and can be read from\n  /sys/module/$MODULE/taint. This per-module information also appears in\n  Oopses.\n- commit 9ed8107\n\n- powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array\n  (bsc#1220250,CVE-2023-52451).\n- commit 9865154\n\n- Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration\n  (CVE-2021-46932 bsc#1220444).\n- commit 8f106a8\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/ipc-mqueue-msg-sem-Avoid-relying-on-a-stack-reference.patch\n  (bsc#1185988, bsc1220826, CVE-2021-47069).\n- commit f01183e\n\n- Update References\n  patches.suse/ACPI-GTDT-Don-t-corrupt-interrupt-mappings-on-watchd.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1220599 CVE-2021-46953).\n- commit 5b10499\n\n- Update References\n  patches.suse/ACPI-custom_method-fix-potential-use-after-free-issu.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1220572 CVE-2021-46966).\n- commit 8eecec3\n\n- efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not\n  supported (bsc#1220328 CVE-2023-52463).\n- commit 0c76724\n\n- RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr (bsc#1220627\n  CVE-2021-47012).\n- commit 96f4478\n\n- mtd: Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifier\n  (bsc#1220238 CVE-2023-52449).\n- commit d23e49b\n\n- Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in\n  powermate_config_complete (CVE-2023-52475 bsc#1220649).\n- HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect\n  (CVE-2023-52478 bsc#1220796).\n- commit 92ea315\n\n- hfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate (bsc#1220737\n  CVE-2021-46989).\n- commit cc37c78\n\n- Update patch reference for qcom bus fix (CVE-2021-47054 bsc#1220767)\n- commit 024411a\n\n- netfilter: nft_limit: avoid possible divide error in\n  nft_limit_init (bsc#1220436 CVE-2021-46915).\n- commit 291b0ff\n\n- NFC: st21nfca: Fix memory leak in device probe and remove\n  (CVE-2021-46924 bsc#1220459).\n- commit 2b46faa\n\n- Update patch reference for HID fix (CVE-2021-46906 bsc#1220421)\n- commit 89e5504\n\n- i2c: Fix a potential use after free (bsc#1220409\n  CVE-2019-25162).\n- commit 6421697\n\n- i2c: cadence: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails\n  (bsc#1220570 CVE-2020-36784).\n- commit 5fa02fa\n\n- KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_\n  sync'ing SRCU (bsc#git-fixes, CVE-2021-47061).\n- commit b2a896d\n\n- Update patch reference for media usb fix (CVE-2020-36777 bsc#1220526)\n- commit f0fcd0d\n\n- media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnection\n  (CVE-2023-52445 bsc#1220241).\n- commit 3f02f88\n\n- nfc: nci: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in\n  send_acknowledge() (bsc#1219125 CVE-2023-46343).\n- commit 9371a32\n\n- uio: Fix use-after-free in uio_open (bsc#1220140\n  CVE-2023-52439).\n- commit 758615f\n\n- apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty\n  (CVE-2023-52443 bsc#1220240).\n- commit 9d07817\n\n- sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier\n  (git-fixes, bsc#1220398, CVE-2024-26602).\n- commit b645222\n\n- i2c: i801: Fix block process call transactions (bsc#1220009\n  CVE-2024-26593).\n- commit c348c97\n\n- netfilter: nftables: avoid overflows in nft_hash_buckets()\n  (CVE-2021-47013 bsc#1220641).\n- commit f0d286e\n\n- net:emac/emac-mac: Fix a use after free in emac_mac_tx_buf_send\n  (CVE-2021-47013 bsc#1220641).\n- commit 378bb67\n\n- mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption (bsc#1220243\n  CVE-2024-26586).\n- mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix NULL pointer dereference in\n  error path (bsc#1220344 CVE-2024-26595).\n- commit 76ed3a3\n\n- EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access (bsc#1220330)\n- commit 5f2e003\n\n- gfs2: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_rgrp_dump\n  (bsc#1220253 CVE-2023-52448).\n- commit a731316\n\n- rpm templates: Always define usrmerged\n  usrmerged is now defined in kernel-spec-macros and not the distribution.\n  Only check if it's defined in kernel-spec-macros, not everywhere where\n  it's used.\n- commit a6ad8af\n\n- KVM: x86: work around QEMU issue with synthetic CPUID leaves (git-fixes).\n- commit fda6073\n\n- blacklist.conf: Blacklist a clang fix\n- commit 6540830\n\n- rpm templates: Move macro definitions below buildrequires\n  Many of the rpm macros defined in the kernel packages depend directly or\n  indirectly on script execution.

This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead. That prevents printing the stale values, generates no\n  output, and generates invalid rpm spec file down the line. Then the\n  problem is flagged early and should be easier to diagnose.\n- commit 8ef8383\n\n- x86/cpu, kvm: Move X86_FEATURE_LFENCE_RDTSC to its native leaf (git-fixes).\n- commit 6d2e676\n\n- KVM: x86: Move open-coded CPUID leaf 0x80000021 EAX bit propagation  code (git-fixes).\n- commit 1f3dbeb\n\n- KVM: x86: synthesize CPUID leaf 0x80000021h if useful (git-fixes).\n- commit 2581a0e\n\n- KVM: x86: add support for CPUID leaf 0x80000021 (git-fixes).\n- commit 79ab1f6\n\n- x86/asm: Add _ASM_RIP() macro for x86-64 (%rip) suffix (git-fixes).\n- commit 26d80bf\n\n- KVM: VMX: Move VERW closer to VMentry for MDS mitigation (git-fixes).\n- KVM: VMX: Use BT+JNC, i.e. EFLAGS.CF to select VMRESUME vs. VMLAUNCH (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Use ALTERNATIVE() instead of mds_user_clear static key (git-fixes).\n  Also add the removed mds_user_clear symbol to kABI severities as it is\n  exposed just for KVM module and is generally a core kernel component so\n  removing it is low risk.\n- x86/entry_32: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Add asm helpers for executing VERW (git-fixes).\n- commit 8f33ff8\n\n- mbcache: Fixup kABI of mb_cache_entry (bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915).\n- commit 52b181f\n\n- ext4: fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption\n  (bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915).\n- commit 14e0a9c\n\n- net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv\n  (bsc#1219127 CVE-2024-23849).\n- commit 75b4a5b\n\n- cifs: fix missing unload_nls() in smb2_reconnect()\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- commit 7236d05\n\n- cifs: fix status checks in cifs_tree_connect (bsc#1213476).\n- commit a4a76da\n\n- smb: client: fix null auth (bsc#1213476).\n- commit 08d9d59\n\n- kernel-binary: Move build script to the end\n  All other spec templates have the build script at the end, only\n  kernel-binary has it in the middle.

It was introduced in 2010 but haven't received\n  any updates on any branch since 2015. The file is renamed by tar-up.sh\n  to config-options.changes.txt and shipped in the kernel-source RPM\n  package under /usr/share/doc. As its content now only contains outdated\n  information, retaining it can lead to confusion for users encountering\n  this file.\n  Config changes are nowadays described in associated Git commit messages,\n  which get automatically collected and are incorporated into changelogs\n  of kernel RPM packages.\n  Drop then this obsolete file, starting with its packaging logic.\n  For branch maintainers: Upon merging this commit on your branch, please\n  correspondingly delete the file doc/config-options.changes.\n- commit adedbd2\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Simplify the list of references (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Reduce indentation in the list of references, make the style consistent\n  with README.md.\n- commit 70e3c33\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Add how to update the config for module signing\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Configuration files for SUSE kernels include settings to integrate with\n  signing support provided by the Open Build Service. This creates\n  problems if someone tries to use such a configuration file to build\n  a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; kernel as described in doc/README.SUSE:\n  * Default configuration files available in the kernel-source repository\n  unset CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL to leave module signing to\n  pesign-obs-integration. In case of a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; build, this\n  integration is not available and the modules don't get signed.\n  * The kernel spec file overrides CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to\n  \u0026quot;.kernel_signing_key.pem\u0026quot; which is a file populated by certificates\n  provided by OBS but otherwise not available. The value ends up in\n  /boot/config-$VERSION-$RELEASE-$FLAVOR and /proc/config.gz. If someone\n  decides to use one of these files as their base configuration then the\n  build fails with an error because the specified module signing key is\n  missing.\n  Add information on how to enable module signing and where to find the\n  relevant upstream documentation.\n- commit a699dc3\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Remove how to build modules using kernel-source\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Remove the first method how to build kernel modules from the readme. It\n  describes a process consisting of the kernel-source installation,\n  configuring this kernel and then performing an ad-hoc module build.\n  This method is not ideal as no modversion data is involved in the\n  process. It results in a module with no symbol CRCs which can be wrongly\n  loaded on an incompatible kernel.\n  Removing the method also simplifies the readme because only two main\n  methods how to build the modules are then described, either doing an\n  ad-hoc build using kernel-devel, or creating a proper Kernel Module\n  Package.\n- commit 9285bb8\n\n- net: mana: Configure hwc timeout from hardware (bsc#1214037).\n- net: mana: Fix MANA VF unload when hardware is unresponsive\n  (bsc#1214764).\n- commit b006ee9\n\n- Call flush_delayed_fput() from nfsd main-loop (bsc#1217408).\n- commit f407bf4\n\n- powerpc: Don't clobber f0/vs0 during fp|altivec register save\n  (bsc#1217780).\n- commit 96932d7\n\n- netfilter: conntrack: dccp: copy entire header to stack buffer,\n  not just basic one (CVE-2023-39197 bsc#1216976).\n- commit 5e51ad1\n\n- kernel-binary: suse-module-tools is also required when installed\n  Requires(pre) adds dependency for the specific sciptlet.\n  However, suse-module-tools also ships modprobe.d files which may be\n  needed at posttrans time or any time the kernel is on the system for\n  generating ramdisk.

(bsc#1214344)\n  To protect itself against userspace corrupting the counter of io_uring\n  dropped submission entries, the kernel relies on a cache of the counter\n  instead of reading the counter directly.  But, the stable patch that was\n  brought to SP3 implementing the this mechanism was done incorrectly, and\n  let's the kernel read from the userspace value instead of the cache in\n  one situation. This allows userspace to subvert the counter, hanging the\n  application forever. Fix the backport to read from the cached value.\n  5.3 stable is long dead, so there is nothing to fix upstream or in\n  - stable.\n- commit 2f88408\n\n- ibmvfc: make 'max_sectors' a module option (bsc#1216223).\n- commit ecc46dc\n\n- scsi: Update max_hw_sectors on rescan (bsc#1216223).\n- commit 2c4e392\n\n- nvme-fc: Prevent null pointer dereference in\n  nvme_fc_io_getuuid() (bsc#1214842).\n- commit b96c59b\n\n- ubi: Refuse attaching if mtd's erasesize is 0 (CVE-2023-31085\n  bsc#1210778).\n- commit cf2c572\n\n- bpf: propagate precision in ALU/ALU64 operations (git-fixes).\n- commit 3cd9fd7\n\n- USB: ene_usb6250: Allocate enough memory for full object\n  (bsc#1216051 CVE-2023-45862).\n- commit 850ea88\n\n- bpf: Fix incorrect verifier pruning due to missing register\n  precision taints (bsc#1215518 CVE-2023-2163).\n- commit 37a3998\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: skip bound chain on rule flush\n  (CVE-2023-3777 bsc#1215095).\n- commit 5558be6\n\n- xen/events: replace evtchn_rwlock with RCU (bsc#1215745,\n  xsa-441, cve-2023-34324).\n- commit 4227b23\n\n- KVM: x86: fix sending PV IPI (git-fixes, bsc#1210853,\n  bsc#1216134).\n- commit 8704b8e\n\n- netfilter: nfnetlink_osf: avoid OOB read (bsc#1216046\n  CVE-2023-39189).\n- commit c154d64\n\n- btrfs: unset reloc control if transaction commit fails in prepare_to_relocate() (bsc#1212051 CVE-2023-3111).\n- commit 2048118\n\n- doc/README.PATCH-POLICY.SUSE: Convert the document to Markdown\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n- commit c05cfc9\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Convert the document to Markdown (jsc#PED-5021)\n- commit bff5e3e\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/ipv6-sr-fix-out-of-bounds-read-when-setting-HMAC-dat.patch\n  (bsc#1211592 CVE-2023-2860).\n- commit 267cf38\n\n- net: xfrm: Fix xfrm_address_filter OOB read (CVE-2023-39194\n  bsc#1215861).\n- commit 1bf7dab\n\n- netfilter: xt_sctp: validate the flag_info count (CVE-2023-39193\n  bsc#1215860).\n- commit 6fc23b4\n\n- netfilter: xt_u32: validate user space input (CVE-2023-39192\n  bsc#1215858).\n- commit 5f8a021\n\n- ipv4: fix null-deref in ipv4_link_failure (CVE-2023-42754\n  bsc#1215467).\n- commit ecc7c7a\n\n- btrfs: fix root ref counts in error handling in\n  btrfs_get_root_ref (bsc#1214351 CVE-2023-4389).\n- commit 14e72e8\n\n- Revert rwsem backport (bsc#1207270 jsc#PED-4567)\n  The rwsem backport enabled database software to run on largest VMs in\n  Azure (M416v2, M832v2).

This override is then used instead of an\n  actual type and allows to preserve modversions (CRCs) of symbols that\n  reference the type. It is kind of an alternative to doing kABI fix-ups\n  with '#ifndef __GENKSYMS__'. The functionality is hidden behind the\n  genksyms --preserve option which primarily tells the tool to strictly\n  verify modversions against a given reference file or fail.\n  Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff which is\n  present in various kernel-source branches separates the override logic.\n  It allows it to be enabled with a new --override flag and used without\n  specifying the --preserve option. Setting KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 in the spec\n  file is then a way how the build is told that --override should be\n  passed to all invocations of genksyms. This was needed for SUSE kernels\n  because their build doesn't use --preserve but instead resulting CRCs\n  are later checked by scripts/kabi.pl.\n  However, this override functionality was not utilized much in practice\n  and the only use currently to be found is in SLE11-SP1-LTSS. It means\n  that no one should miss this option and KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 together with\n  patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be removed.\n  Notes for maintainers merging this commit to their branches:\n  * Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be\n  dropped after merging this commit.\n  * Branch SLE11-SP1-LTSS uses the mentioned override functionality and\n  this commit should not be merged to it, or needs to be reverted\n  afterwards.\n- commit 4aa02b8\n\n- cifs: do all necessary checks for credits within or before\n  locking (bsc#1213476).\n- commit ce2dc27\n\n- cifs: avoid use of global locks for high contention data\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- Refresh patches.suse/cifs-set-resolved-ip-in-sockaddr.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/cifs-Fix-UAF-in-cifs_demultiplex_thread-.patch.\n- commit 7ce18a4\n\n- cifs: get rid of mount options string parsing (bsc#1213476).\n- commit a615bd3\n\n- cifs: use fs_context for automounts (bsc#1213476).\n- commit 231aad6\n\n- cifs: set correct ipc status after initial tree connect\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/cifs-set-correct-tcon-status-after-initial-tree-connect.patch.\n- commit abf3572\n\n- cifs: set correct tcon status after initial tree connect\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- commit a4030d4\n\n- Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free in l2cap_sock_ready_cb\n  (bsc#1214233 CVE-2023-40283).\n- commit 11dc4cc\n\n- Refresh patches.suse/powerpc-Move-DMA64_PROPNAME-define-to-a-header.patch.\n- commit d263157\n\n- x86/speculation: Mark all Skylake CPUs as vulnerable to GDS (git-fixes).\n- commit a3ff58c\n\n- drm/vmwgfx: Test shader type against SVGA3d_SHADERTYPE_MIN (bsc#1203517 CVE-2022-36402)\n- commit 5b2dbae\n\n- cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread() (bsc#1208995\n  CVE-2023-1192).\n- commit 87f52bf\n\n- powerpc/rtas: remove ibm_suspend_me_token (bsc#1023051).\n- commit 4f01e57\n\n- Do not add and remove genksyms ifdefs\n- Refresh patches.kabi/lockdown-kABI-workaround-for-lockdown_reason-changes.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/lockdown-also-lock-down-previous-kgdb-use.patch.\n- commit e497b88\n\n- powerpc/rtas: move syscall filter setup into separate function\n  (bsc#1023051).\n- commit a36442d\n\n- rpm/mkspec-dtb: support for nested subdirs\n  Commit 724ba6751532 (\u0026quot;ARM: dts: Move .dts files to vendor\n  sub-directories\u0026quot;) moved the dts to nested subdirs, add a support for\n  that.

The function DH_check() performs\n    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it\n    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\n    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A\n    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus\n    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if\n    q is larger than p.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks\n    use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found\n    to be too large.\n    A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Reworked the Fix for the Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n    The previous fix for this timing side channel turned out to cause\n    a severe 2-3x performance regression in the typical use case\n    compared to 1.1.1s.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2022-4304.patch\n  * Removed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n  * Refreshed openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n\n- Update further expiring certificates that affect tests [bsc#1201627]\n  * Add openssl-Update-further-expiring-certificates.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430]\n  * Possible DoS translating ASN.1 object identifiers\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-2650.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0465, bsc#1209878]\n  * Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0465.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0466, bsc#1209873]\n  * Certificate policy check not enabled\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0466.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0464, bsc#1209624]\n  * Excessive Resource Usage Verifying X.509 Policy Constraints\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0464.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207533, CVE-2023-0286]\n  * Fix X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GENERAL_NAME_cmp\n    for x400Address\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207536, CVE-2023-0215]\n  * Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF()\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-1of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-2of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-3of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-4of4.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207538, CVE-2022-4450]\n  * Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex()\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4450-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4450-2of2.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n\n- FIPS: list only FIPS approved public key algorithms\n  [bsc#1121365, bsc#1198472]\n  * Add openssl-1_1-fips-list-only-approved-pubkey-algorithms.patch\n\nPackage parted was updated:\n\n- fix null pointer dereference (bsc#1193412)  - add: parted-fix-check-diskp-in-do_name.patch\n- update mkpart options in manpage (bsc#1182142)\n  - add: parted-mkpart-manpage.patch\n\nPackage pciutils was updated:\n\n- Apply \u0026quot;lspci-Fixed-buffer-overflows-in-ls-tree.c.patch\u0026quot; to fix a  buffer overflow error that would cause lspci to crash on systems\n  with complex topologies.

Later\n  commands running with user privileges may not be able to access\n  these repos.\n- version 17.32.4 (32)\n\n- Update RepoStatus fromCookieFile according to the files mtime\n  (bsc#1222086)\n- TmpFile: Don't call chmod if makeSibling failed.\n- version 17.32.3 (32)\n\n- Fixup New VendorSupportOption flag VendorSupportSuperseded\n  (jsc#OBS-301, jsc#PED-8014)\n  Fixed the name of the keyword to \u0026quot;support_superseded\u0026quot; as it was\n  agreed on in jsc#OBS-301.\n- version 17.32.2 (32)\n\n- Add resolver option 'removeUnneeded' to file weak remove jobs\n  for unneeded packages (bsc#1175678)\n- version 17.32.1 (32)\n\n- Add resolver option 'removeOrphaned' for distupgrade\n  (bsc#1221525)\n- New VendorSupportOption flag VendorSupportSuperseded\n  (jsc#OBS-301, jsc#PED-8014)\n- Tests: fix vsftpd.conf where SUSE and Fedora use different\n  defaults (fixes #522)\n- Add default stripe minimum (#529)\n- Don't expose std::optional where YAST/PK explicitly use c++11.\n- Digest: Avoid using the deprecated OPENSSL_config.\n- version 17.32.0 (32)\n\n- ProblemSolution::skipsPatchesOnly overload to handout the\n  patches.\n- Remove https-\u0026gt;http redirection exceptions for\n  download.opensuse.org.\n- version 17.31.32 (22)\n\n- tui: allow to access the underlying ostream of out::Info.\n- Add MLSep: Helper to produce not-NL-terminated multi line\n  output.\n- version 17.31.31 (22)\n\n- applydeltaprm: Create target directory if it does not exist\n  (bsc#1219442)\n- Add ProblemSolution::skipsPatchesOnly (for openSUSE/zypper#514)\n- Fix problems with EINTR in ExternalDataSource::getline (fixes\n  bsc#1215698)\n- version 17.31.30 (22)\n\n- CheckAccessDeleted: fix running_in_container detection\n  (bsc#1218782)\n- Detect CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS_STR availability at runtime\n  (bsc#1218831)\n- Make Wakeup class EINTR safe.\n- Add a way to cancel media operations on shutdown\n  (openSUSE/zypper#522)\n  This patch adds a mechanism to signal libzypp that a shutdown was\n  requested, usually when CTRL+C was pressed by the user. Currently\n  only the media backend will utilize this, but can be extended to\n  all code paths that use g_poll() to wait for events.\n- Manually poll fds for curl in MediaCurl.\n  Using curl_easy_perform does not give us the required control on\n  when we want to cancel a download. Switching to the MultiCurl\n  implementation with a external poll() event loop will give us\n  much more freedom and helps us to improve our Ctrl+C handling.\n- Move reusable curl poll code to curlhelper.h.\n- version 17.31.29 (22)\n\n- Fix to build with libxml 2.12.x (fixes #505)\n- version 17.31.28 (22)\n\n- CheckAccessDeleted: fix 'running in container' filter\n  (bsc#1218291)\n- version 17.31.27 (22)\n\n- Call zypp commit plugins during transactional update (fixes #506)\n- Add support for loongarch64 (fixes #504)\n- Teach MediaMultiCurl to download HTTP Multibyte ranges.\n- Teach zsync downloads to MultiCurl.\n- Expand RepoVars in URLs downloading a .repo file (bsc#1212160)\n  Convenient and helps documentation as it may refer to a single\n  command for a bunch of distributions. Like e.g. \u0026quot;zypper ar\n  'https://server.my/$releasever/my.repo'\u0026quot;.\n- version 17.31.26 (22)\n\n- Fix build issue with zchunk build flags (fixes #500)\n- version 17.31.25 (22)\n\n- Open rpmdb just once during execution of %posttrans scripts\n  (bsc#1216412)\n- Avoid using select() since it does not support fd numbers \u0026gt;\n  1024 (fixes #447)\n- tools/DownloadFiles: use standard zypp progress bar (fixes #489)\n- Revert \u0026quot;Color download progress bar\u0026quot; (fixes #475)\n  Cyan is already used for the output of RPM scriptlets. Avoid this\n  colorific collision between download progress bar and scriptlet\n  output.\n- Fix ProgressBar's calculation of the printed tag position (fixes #494)\n- Switch zypp::Digest to Openssl 3.0 Provider API (fixes #144)\n- Fix usage of deprecated CURL features (fixes #486)\n- version 17.31.24 (22)\n\n- Stop using boost version 1 timer library (fixes #489,\n  bsc#1215294)\n- version 17.31.23 (22)\n\n- Preliminary disable 'rpm --runposttrans' usage for chrooted\n  systems (bsc#1216091)\n  This limits the %transfiletrigger(postun|in) support in the\n  default installer if --root is used (as described in bsc#1041742).\n  The chrooted execution of the scripts in 'rpm --runposttrans'\n  broke in rpm-4.18. It's expected to be fixed in rpm-4.19.\n  Then we'll enable the feature again.\n- fix comment typo on zypp.conf (boo#1215979)\n- version 17.31.22 (22)\n\n- Attempt to delay %transfiletrigger(postun|in) execution if rpm\n  supports it (bsc#1041742)\n  Decide during installation whether rpm is capable of delayed\n  %posttrans %transfiletrigger(postun|in) execution or whether we\n  can just handle the packages %posttrans. On TW a delayed\n  %transfiletrigger handling is possible since rpm-4.17.\n- Make sure the old target is deleted before a new one is created\n  (bsc#1203760)\n- version 17.31.21 (22)\n\n- Fixup changes for 17.31.16. Remove faulty reference to a bug\n  actually fixed in 2019.\n- version 17.31.20 (22)\n\n- Fix zypp-tui/output/Out.h to build with clang.\n- Fix zypp/Arch.h for clang (fixes #478)\n  Clang seems to have issues with picking the overload in\n  std::men_fn if there is a static overload of a member function.\n  We need to explicitely specify the correct type of the function\n  pointer. To make sure this would not break compiling a\n  application with clang that builds against libzypp this patch\n  works around the problem.\n- version 17.31.19 (22)\n\n- SINGLE_RPMTRANS: Respect ZYPP_READONLY_HACK when checking the\n  zypp-rpm lock (fixes openSUSE/openSUSE-repos#29)\n- version 17.31.18 (22)\n\n- Fix wrong filesize exceeded dl abort in zyppng::Downloader\n  (bsc#1213673)\n  In some cases when downloading very small files we can run into\n  issues when the URL is protected by credentials.\n- version 17.31.17 (22)\n\n- Fix negative ZYPP_LOCK_TIMEOUT not waiting forever (bsc#1213231)\n- Don't cleanup orphaned dirs if read-only mode was promised\n  (bsc#1210740)\n- version 17.31.16 (22)\n\n- Fix build against protobuf \u0026gt;= 22 (fixes #465, closes #466)\n  Port away from protobuf_generate_cpp. Upstream protobuf does not\n  export protobuf_generate_cpp by default anymore.\n  Use protobuf_generate instead, which is also available on older\n  versions.\n- Remove SUSE \u0026lt; SLE11 constructs (fixes #464).\n- version 17.31.15 (22)\n\n- build: honor libproxy.pc's includedir (bsc#1212222)\n- Curl: trim all custom headers (bsc#1212187)\n  HTTP/2 RFC 9113 forbids fields ending with a space. So we make\n  sure all custom headers are trimmed. This also includes headers\n  returned by URL-Resolver plugins.\n- version 17.31.14 (22)\n\n- curl: Trim user agent string (bsc#1212187)\n  HTTP/2 RFC 9113 forbids fields ending with a space. Violation\n  results in curl error: 92: HTTP/2 PROTOCOL_ERROR.\n- version 17.31.13 (22)\n\n- Do not unconditionally release a medium if provideFile failed\n  (bsc#1211661)\n- libzypp.spec.cmake: remove duplicate file listing.\n- version 17.31.12 (22)\n\n- MediaCurl: Fix endless loop if wrong credentials are stored in\n  credentials.cat (bsc#1210870)\n  Since libzypp-17.31.7 wrong credentials stored in credentials.cat\n  may lead to an endless loop. Rather than asking for the right\n  credentials, the stored ones are used again and again.\n- zypp.conf: Introduce 'download.connect_timeout' [60 sec.]\n  (bsc#1208329)\n  Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection phase to\n  the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, it has\n  no impact once it has connected. (see also CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT)\n- commit: Try to provide /dev fs if not present (fixes #444)\n- fix build with boost 1.82.\n- version 17.31.11 (22)\n\n- fix build with boost 1.82\n\n- BuildRequires: libsolv-devel \u0026gt;= 0.7.24 for x86_64_v[234]\n  support.\n- version 17.31.10 (22)\n\n- Workround bsc#1195633 while libsolv \u0026lt;= 0.7.23 is used.\n- Fix potential endless loop in new ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK.\n- ZYPP_METALINK_DEBUG=1: Log URL and priority of the mirrors\n  parsed from a metalink file.\n- multicurl: propagate ssl settings stored in repo url\n  (boo#1127591)\n  Closes #335.\n- Teach MediaNetwork to retry on HTTP2 errors.\n- fix CapDetail to return Rel::NONE if an EXPRESSION is used as a\n  NAMED cap.\n- Capability: support parsing richdeps from string.\n- defaultLoadSystem: default to LS_NOREFRESH if not root.\n- Detect x86_64_v[234]: Fix LZCNT bit used in detection (fixes\n  [#439])\n  Merges rpm-software-management/rpm#2412: The bit for LZCNT is in\n  CPUID 0x80000001, not 1.\n- Detect x86_64_v[234] architecture levels (fixes #439)\n- Support x86_64_v[234] architecture levels (for #439)\n- version 17.31.9 (22)\n\n- ProgressData: enforce reporting the INIT||END state\n  (bsc#1206949)\n- ps: fix service detection on newer Tumbleweed systems\n  (bsc#1205636)\n- version 17.31.8 (22)\n\n- Hint to \u0026quot;zypper removeptf\u0026quot; to remove PTFs.\n- Removing a PTF without enabled repos should always fail\n  (bsc#1203248)\n  Without enabled repos, the dependent PTF-packages would be\n  removed (not replaced!) as well. To remove a PTF \u0026quot;zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot; or a dedicated \u0026quot;zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot; should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage shadow was updated:\n\n- bsc#1228770: Fix not copying of skel files  Update shadow-CVE-2013-4235.patch\n\n- bsc#916845 (CVE-2013-4235): Fix TOCTOU race condition\n  Add shadow-CVE-2013-4235.patch\n\n- bsc#1214806 (CVE-2023-4641):\n  Fix potential password leak\n- Add shadow-CVE-2023-4641.patch\n\n- bsc#1213189: Change lock mechanism to file locking to prevent\n  lock files after power interruptions\n- Add shadow-4.8.1-lock-mechanism.patch\n\n- bsc#1206627: Add --prefix support to passwd, chpasswd and chage\n  Needed for YaST\n- Add shadow-4.8.1-add-prefix-passwd-chpasswd-chage.patch\n\n- bsc#1210507 (CVE-2023-29383):\n  Check for control characters\n- Add shadow-CVE-2023-29383.patch\n\nPackage man was updated:\n\n- Use inverted exit status in exec option of find command to  avoid refreshing man database (boo#1155879)\n\n- Minor corrections on %ghost /var/cache/man\n\nPackage mozilla-nspr was updated:\n\n- update to version 4.35  * fixes for building with clang\n  * use the number of online processors for the\n    PR_GetNumberOfProcessors() API on some platforms\n  * fix build on mips+musl libc\n  * Add support for the LoongArch 64-bit architecture\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Require `sed` for mozilla-nss-sysinit, as setup-nsssysinit.sh  depends on it and will create a broken, empty config, if sed is\n  missing (bsc#1227918)\n\n- update to NSS 3.101.2\n  * bmo#1905691 -

(Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\n- timezone update 2023c:\n  * Revert changes made in 2023b\n- timezone update 2023b:\n  *

US\n    will change to agree with nearby US locations on 2022-11-30.\n    The strip's western part, represented by Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, switches\n    from -06 all year to -07/-06 with US DST rules, like El Paso, TX.\n    The eastern part, represented by Ojinaga, will observe US DST next\n    year, like Presidio, TX.\n    A new Zone America/Ciudad_Juarez splits from America/Ojinaga.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, stops observing\n    winter time after March 2023, so its daylight saving time becomes\n    standard time.\n  * Changes for pre-1996 northern Canada\n  * Update to past DST transition in Colombia (1993), Singapore\n    (1981)\n  * timegm is now supported by default\n\n- timezone update 2022f (bsc#1177460):\n  * Mexico will no longer observe DST except near

But the patch failed\n  to also rename the completion script. The original script name\n  zypper.sh is not recognized at the new location.\n- Update notes about failing signature checks (bsc#1214395)\n  It might be a transient issue if the server is in the midst of\n  receiving new data. Retry after a few minutes might work.\n- Improve the SIGINT handler to be signal safe (bsc#1214292)\n  This patch updates the SIGINT handling strategy to be signal\n  safe. Meaning the signal handler will do not much more than\n  setting a flag, which we are going to check in the normal program\n  flow as much as possible.\n- version 1.14.64\n\n- Changed location of bash completion script (bsc#1213854).\n  This changes the location of zypper.sh bash completion script\n  from /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/.\n- version 1.14.63\n\n- man: revised explanation of --force-resolution (bsc#1213557)\n  Point out that the option not only allows to remove packages but\n  may also violate any other active policy if there is no other way\n  to resolve the job.\n- Print summary hint if policies were violated due to\n  - -force-resolution (bsc#1213557)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.16 (for zypp-tui)\n- version 1.14.62\n\n- targetos: Add an error note if XPath:/product/register/target\n  is not defined in /etc/products.d/baseproduct (bsc#1211261)\n- targetos: Update help and man page (bsc#1211261)\n- version 1.14.61\n\n- Fix selecting installed patterns from picklist (bsc#1209406)\n- man: better explanation of --priority (fixes #480)\n- version 1.14.60\n\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.7.\n- Provide \u0026quot;removeptf\u0026quot; command (bsc#1203249)\n  A remove command which prefers replacing dependant packages to\n  removing them as well.\n  A PTF is typically removed as soon as the fix it provides is\n  applied to the latest official update of the dependant packages.\n  But you don't want the dependant packages to be removed together\n  with the PTF, which is what the remove command would do. The\n  removeptf command however will aim to replace the dependant\n  packages by their official update versions.\n- patterns: Avoid dispylaing superfluous @System entries\n  (bsc#1205570)\n- version 1.14.59\n\n- Update man page and explain '.no_auto_prune' (bsc#1204956)\n- Allow to (re)add a service with the same URL (bsc#1203715)\n- Explain outdatedness of repos (fixes #463)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.5\n- version 1.14.58\n\n",

The ib_prctl_set  function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall.  The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96\n\n",

The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28.\n\n",
