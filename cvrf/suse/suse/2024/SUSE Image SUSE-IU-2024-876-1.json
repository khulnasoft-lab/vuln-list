support status can be obtained at runtime for each\n  module from /sys/module/$MODULE/supported and for the entire system\n  from /sys/kernel/supported. This provides a way how to now check that\n  the kernel has any externally supported modules loaded.\n  * Remove a mention that externally supported modules taint the kernel,\n  but keep the information about bit 16 (X) and add a note that it is\n  still tracked per module and can be read from\n  /sys/module/$MODULE/taint. This per-module information also appears in\n  Oopses.\n- commit 9ed8107\n\n- btrfs: fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot\n  creation failure (bsc#1219126 CVE-2024-23850).\n- commit

distribution.\n  Only check if it's defined in kernel-spec-macros, not everywhere where\n  it's used.\n- commit a6ad8af\n\n- nvme: remove nvme_alloc_request and nvme_alloc_request_qid\n  (bsc#1214064).\n  Refresh:\n  - patches.suse/nvme-tcp-delay-error-recovery-until-the-next-kato.patch\n- commit 6fc2117\n\n- rpm templates: Move macro definitions below buildrequires\n  Many of the rpm macros defined in the kernel packages depend directly or\n  indirectly on script execution. OBS cannot execute scripts which means\n  values of these macros cannot be used in tags that are required for OBS\n  to see such as package name, buildrequires or buildarch.\n  Accumulate macro definitions that are not directly expanded by mkspec\n  below buildrequires and buildarch to make this distinction clear.\n- commit 89eaf4c\n\n- rpm/check-for-config-changes: add GCC_ASM_GOTO_OUTPUT_WORKAROUND to IGNORED_CONFIGS_RE\n  Introduced by commit 68fb3ca0e408 (\u0026quot;update workarounds for gcc \u0026quot;asm\n  goto\u0026quot; issue\u0026quot;).\n- commit be1bdab\n\n- net: openvswitch: limit the number of recursions from action\n  sets (bsc#1219835 CVE-2024-1151).\n- commit ed2fd55\n\n- README.BRANCH: use correct mail for Roy\n- commit 6f3c32f\n\n- compute-PATCHVERSION: Do not produce output when awk fails\n  compute-PATCHVERSION uses awk to produce a shell script that is\n  subsequently executed to update shell variables which are then printed\n  as the patchversion.\n  Some versions of awk, most notably bysybox-gawk do not understand the\n  awk program and fail to run. This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead. That prevents printing the stale values, generates no\n  output, and generates invalid rpm spec file down the line. Then the\n  problem is flagged early and should be easier to diagnose.\n- commit 8ef8383\n\n- nvme: move nvme_stop_keep_alive() back to original position\n  (bsc#1211515).\n- commit b945fa0\n\n- x86/asm: Add _ASM_RIP() macro for x86-64 (%rip) suffix (git-fixes).\n- commit 636fc4c\n\n- KVM: VMX: Move VERW closer to VMentry for MDS mitigation (git-fixes).\n- KVM: VMX: Use BT+JNC, i.e. EFLAGS.CF to select VMRESUME vs. VMLAUNCH (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Use ALTERNATIVE() instead of mds_user_clear static key (git-fixes).\n  Also add the removed mds_user_clear symbol to kABI severities as it is\n  exposed just for KVM module and is generally a core kernel component so\n  removing it is low risk.\n- x86/entry_32: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Add asm helpers for executing VERW (git-fixes).\n- commit 5b0be3c\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: disallow rule removal from chain binding\n  (bsc#1218216 CVE-2023-5197).\n- commit d7a1a4d\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: skip bound chain in netns release path\n  (bsc#1218216 CVE-2023-5197).\n- commit af879c8\n\n- nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup (bsc#1211515).\n- commit 13f904b\n\n- net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv\n  (bsc#1219127 CVE-2024-23849).\n- commit 43577c1\n\n- kernel-binary: Move build script to the end\n  All other spec templates have the build script at the end, only\n  kernel-binary has it in the middle. Align with the other templates.\n- commit 98cbdd0\n\n- rpm templates: Aggregate subpackage descriptions\n  While in some cases the package tags, description, scriptlets and\n  filelist are located together in other cases they are all across the\n  spec file.

Currently\n  only the media backend will utilize this, but can be extended to\n  all code paths that use g_poll() to wait for events.\n- Manually poll fds for curl in MediaCurl.\n  Using curl_easy_perform does not give us the required control on\n  when we want to cancel a download. Switching to the MultiCurl\n  implementation with a external poll() event loop will give us\n  much more freedom and helps us to improve our Ctrl+C handling.\n- Move reusable curl poll code to curlhelper.h.\n- version 17.31.29 (22)\n\n- Fix to build with libxml 2.12.x (fixes #505)\n- version 17.31.28 (22)\n\nPackage shadow was updated:\n\n- bsc#1228770: Fix not copying of skel files  Update shadow-CVE-2013-4235.patch\n\n- bsc#916845 (CVE-2013-4235): Fix TOCTOU race condition\n  Add shadow-CVE-2013-4235.patch\n\n- bsc#1176006: Fix chage date miscalculation\n  Add shadow-bsc1176006-chage-date.patch\n- bsc#1188307: Fix passwd segfault\n  Add shadow-bsc1188307-passwd-segfault.patch\n- bsc#1203823: Remove pam_keyinit from PAM config files\n  Remove pam_keyinit from PAM configuration.\n  This was introduced for bsc#1144060.\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Require `sed` for mozilla-nss-sysinit, as setup-nsssysinit.sh  depends on it and will create a broken, empty config, if sed is\n  missing (bsc#1227918)\n\n- update to NSS 3.101.2\n  * bmo#1905691 - ChaChaXor to return after the function\n\n- Added nss-fips-safe-memset.patch, fixing bsc#1222811.\n- Removed some dead code from nss-fips-constructor-self-tests.patch.\n- Rebased nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch on above changes.\n- Added nss-fips-aes-gcm-restrict.patch, fixing bsc#1222830.\n- Updated nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch, fixing bsc#1222813,\n  bsc#1222814, bsc#1222821, bsc#1222822, bsc#1224118.\n- Updated nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch and\n  nss-fips-constructor-self-tests.patch, fixing bsc#1222807,\n  bsc#1222828, bsc#1222834.\n- Updated nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch, fixing bsc#1222804,\n  bsc#1222826, bsc#1222833, bsc#1224113, bsc#1224115, bsc#1224116.\n\n- update to NSS 3.101.1\n  * bmo#1901932 - missing sqlite header.\n  * bmo#1901080 - GLOBALTRUST 2020: Set Distrust After for TLS and S/MIME.\n- update to NSS 3.101\n  * bmo#1900413 - add diagnostic assertions for SFTKObject refcount.\n  * bmo#1899759 - freeing the slot in DeleteCertAndKey if authentication failed\n  * bmo#1899883 - fix formatting issues.\n  * bmo#1889671 - Add Firmaprofesional CA Root-A Web to NSS.\n  * bmo#1899593 - remove invalid acvp fuzz test vectors.\n  * bmo#1898830 - pad short P-384 and P-521 signatures gtests.\n  * bmo#1898627 - remove unused FreeBL ECC code.\n  * bmo#1898830 - pad short P-384 and P-521 signatures.\n  * bmo#1898825 - be less strict about ECDSA private key length.\n  * bmo#1854439 - Integrate HACL* P-521.\n  * bmo#1854438 - Integrate HACL* P-384.\n  * bmo#1898074 - memory leak in create_objects_from_handles.\n  * bmo#1898858 - ensure all input is consumed in a few places in mozilla::pkix\n  * bmo#1884444 - SMIME/CMS and PKCS #12 do not integrate with modern NSS policy\n  * bmo#1748105 - clean up escape handling\n  * bmo#1896353 - Use lib::pkix as default validator instead of the old-one\n  * bmo#1827444 - Need to add high level support for PQ signing.\n  * bmo#1548723 - Certificate Compression: changing the allocation/freeing of buffer + Improving the documentation\n  * bmo#1884444 - SMIME/CMS and PKCS #12 do not integrate with modern NSS policy\n  * bmo#1893404 - Allow for non-full length ecdsa signature when using softoken\n  * bmo#1830415 - Modification of .taskcluster.yml due to mozlint indent defects\n  * bmo#1793811 - Implement support for PBMAC1 in PKCS#12\n  * bmo#1897487 - disable VLA warnings for fuzz builds.\n  * bmo#1895032 - remove redundant AllocItem implementation.\n  * bmo#1893334 - add PK11_ReadDistrustAfterAttribute.\n  * bmo#215997  - Clang-formatting of SEC_GetMgfTypeByOidTag update\n  * bmo#1895012 - Set SEC_ERROR_LIBRARY_FAILURE on self-test failure\n  * bmo#1894572 - sftk_getParameters(): Fix fallback to default variable after error with configfile.\n  * bmo#1830415 - Switch to the mozillareleases/image_builder image\n- Follow upstream changes in nss-fips-constructor-self-tests.patch (switch from ec_field_GFp to ec_field_plain)\n- Remove part of nss-fips-zeroization.patch that got removed upstream\n- update to NSS 3.100\n  - bmo#1893029 - merge pk11_kyberSlotList into pk11_ecSlotList for\n    faster Xyber operations.\n  - bmo#1893752 - remove ckcapi.\n  - bmo#1893162 - avoid a potential PK11GenericObject memory leak.\n  - bmo#671060  - Remove incomplete ESDH code.\n  - bmo#215997  - Decrypt RSA OAEP encrypted messages.\n  - bmo#1887996 - Fix certutil CRLDP URI code.\n  - bmo#1890069 - Don't set CKA_DERIVE for CKK_EC_EDWARDS private keys.\n  - bmo#676118  - Add ability to encrypt and decrypt CMS messages using ECDH.\n  - bmo#676100  - Correct Templates for key agreement in smime/cmsasn.c.\n  - bmo#1548723 - Moving the decodedCert allocation to NSS.\n  - bmo#1885404 - Allow developers to speed up repeated local execution\n    of NSS tests that depend on certificates.\n- update to NSS 3.99\n  * Removing check for message len in ed25519 (bmo#1325335)\n  * add ed25519 to SECU_ecName2params.

Make sure that the packages ordered\n  after systemd are also ordered after systemd-sysvcompat so theirs rpm\n  scriptlets can still rely on the compat scripts.\n  On distributions where systemd-sysvcompat doesn't exist, the new ordering\n  constraint should be a nop.\n\nPackage timezone was updated:\n\n- update to 2024a:  * Kazakhstan unifies on UTC+5.  This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage util-linux-systemd was updated:\n\n- Properly neutralize escape sequences in wall  (util-linux-CVE-2024-28085.patch, bsc#1221831, CVE-2024-28085,\n  and its prerequisites: util-linux-fputs_careful1.patch,\n  util-linux-wall-migrate-to-memstream.patch\n  util-linux-fputs_careful2.patch).\n\n- Add upstream patch\n  more-exit-if-POLLERR-and-POLLHUP-on-stdin-is-received.patch\n  bsc#1220117 -
