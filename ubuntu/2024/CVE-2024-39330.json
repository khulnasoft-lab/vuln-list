  "Description": "Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class which override generate_filename() without replicating the file path validations existing in the parent class, allow for potential directory-traversal via certain inputs when calling save(). Built-in Storage sub-classes were not affected by this vulnerability.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e upstream advises that only versions 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1 (plus main development branch) are affected but it is likely earlier versions may also be affected but upstream do not mention this as they are no longer maintained by them"
