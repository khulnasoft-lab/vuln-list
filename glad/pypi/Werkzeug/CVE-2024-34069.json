  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-34069",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Werkzeug",
  "Title": "Werkzeug debugger vulnerable to remote execution when interacting with attacker controlled domain",
  "Description": "The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.",
