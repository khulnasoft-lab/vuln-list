manually\n- Fixing Bug 2001567 - update of JDK/JRE is removing its manually selected alterantives and select (as auto) system JDK/JRE\n-- The move of alternatives creation to posttrans to fix:\n-- Bug 1200302 - dnf reinstall breaks alternatives\n-- Had caused the alternatives to be removed, and then created again,\n-- instead of being added, and then removing the old, and thus persisting\n-- the selection in family\n-- Thus this fix, is storing the family of manually selected master, and if\n-- stored, then it is restoring the family of the master\n- Resolves:

system JDK and ensures the JDK being built can do a full build\n- Turn off bootstrapping for slow debug builds, which are particularly slow on ppc64le.\n- Handle Fedora in distro conditionals that currently only pertain to RHEL.\n- Run OpenJDK normalizer script on the spec file to fix further rogue whitespace\n- Sync gdb test with java-1.8.0-openjdk and improve architecture restrictions.\n- Introduce stapinstall variable to set SystemTap arch directory correctly (e.g. arm64 on aarch64)\n- Need to support noarch for creating source RPMs for non-scratch builds.\n- Replace -mstackrealign with -mincoming-stack-boundary=2 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=4 on x86_32 for stack alignment\n- Support a HotSpot-only build so a freshly built libjvm.so can then be used in the bootstrap JDK.\n-
